# Training: Google Colab 💻
Welcome to this repository of training materials for working with Google Colab.

📜 The training materials will be written using a mixture of the below:
- Python
- Shell
- Git script
- R

# Who are these training materials for? 👔
These training materials are designed with people who wish to use and work in Google Colab to share their interactive notebooks with other people. 

The framework is that they code and version-control entirely within a Google Colab notebook.

Whilst not advised to version-control entirely within a Google Colab notebook, it may be necessary if you are unable to use Git on your local desktop. For instance, you might be using a Chromebook which doesn't seem to have the facility to download and install programs such as Git (to my knowledge!).

# Is there anything I need alongside this repo? 👀
Other than an internet connection and a Google account, nothing else is required! Well, okay, you might need to exert some 🧠 power and be ready like this 👩‍💻.

The beauty of Google Colab is that you can pretty much get in and start coding.
